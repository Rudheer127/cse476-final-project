Wait, that sounds like a liquid. Because liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of the container. Gases, on the other hand, expand to fill the container, so they don't have a definite volume. Wait, but the question says propane is a gas at room temperature. So, if it's a gas, then it would take the shape of the container and expand to fill it. So, does that mean it has an indefinite volume? Because gases don't have a fixed volume. So, the correct answer would be... Let me check the options again. Option A says definite volume, which would be incorrect. Option B says indefinite volume and takes the shape of the container.

The conversion process captures each file's text content and stores it in a CSV with a single 'Text' column, without row indices. The function overwrites existing files in the target directory if they have the same names as the converted files. The function ensures that only files with the specified extensions are processed. The function raises a FileNotFoundError if the source directory does not exist. The function uses pandas to handle CSV creation and file operations. The function ensures that the target directory exists before processing files. The function processes each file in the source directory, extracts its text content, and saves it as a CSV in the target directory. The function returns the"
